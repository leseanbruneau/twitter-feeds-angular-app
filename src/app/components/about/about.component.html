    <p class="mb-5">Some technical details about this site for those who are interested.  I won't get too deep into the code details, just some 
      high level notes on what I learned setting up a static website on Angular framework.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably most important thing to point out - This is a simple website for training purposes.  If the Twitter handles suddenly change around the 
      end of April to a bunch of horse racing analysts before the Kentucky Derby, well it is not my fault.  "Corporate HQ" make all the big decisions in 
      Crazy Town, USA.

      Actually I'll add more notes later.

        While certainly not required to set up a static web site, Angular framework help organize web site development.  The more content added to the
        web site creates more complexity.  Organizing a site into components helps break down the web site content into more manageable parts.  This
        is where the Angular framework comes in.

        Easiest way to get started is the <a href="https://angular.io/guide/quickstart" target="_blank">Angular Quick Start</a> guide.  If you are interested in learning more about Angular, I would recommend a book or training
        video to get started building examples more details about Angular.  I found a couple training videos on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank">Udemy</a> and
        <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/"  target="_blank">Packt Publishing</a> to be helpful.

        Quick note regarding AWS S3 website hosting an Angular application.  As mentioned earlier, AWS S3 website will not have root ("/") as default context path.
        By default, a new Angular application generated from ng-new will use a root context "/" path, which will not work with a simple AWS S3 website.  To fix this
        situation, after creating a new Angular application, update the default index.html with your AWS S3 bucket name.  Specifically, change:
      </p>
      <p class="pl-5">
          <strong>base href="/"</strong>  tag to <strong>base href="/%%YOUR_AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME%%/"</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This change will tell Angular application to add AWS S3 bucket name to the URL path that is appended on <strong>http://s3.amazonaws.com/</strong> site.

        Twitter Timeline Feed:  If you are interested in added one to your website, follow instructions here:

      </p>
      <p>
        Note regarding Twitter Timeline Feed on an Angular site:  I had an issue with the Twitter timeline display on initial page load.  The issue is caused by
        the Angular routing not starting the Twitter widget when the component loads.  To get around this issue, follow the instructions posted on this
        stackoverview post.
