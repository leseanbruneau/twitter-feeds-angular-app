    Some technical details about this site for those who are interested.  Information below is not intended for a step-by-step guide on how to code a site.  
    The information below is intended to be a high level guide for what steps need to be done to complete an application.  
    Specific code for this site can be found in the following git repository:

  </p>
  <p>
    Probably most important thing to point out - This is a simple website for training purposes.  If the Twitter feeds suddenly change around the 
    end of April to a bunch of horse racing analysts right before the Kentucky Derby, well it is not my fault.  "Corporate HQ" make all the big decisions in 
    Crazy Town, USA, including content on this test site.

  <p>To use code from GitHub repository (run from command line, except for comment lines that start with #): </p>
  <div class="mb-5 pl-5">
    <p class="mb-0"># Clone repo - will create a new twitter-feeds-angular-app directory in directory command is run from</p>
    <p class="mb-2"><strong>git clone https://github.com/leseanbruneau/twitter-feeds-angular-app.git</strong></p>
  
    <p class="mb-0"># change directory to application root directory</p>
    <p class="mb-2"><strong>cd twitter-feeds-angular-app</strong></p>
  
    <p class="mb-0"># install node_modules - will need Nodejs and Angular Cli installed on workstation</p>
    <p class="mb-2"><strong>npm install --save-dev</strong></p>
  
    <p class="mb-0"># Run application on development server</p>
    <p class="mb-2"><strong>ng serve</strong></p>
  
    <p class="mb-0"># Create distrobution build for deployment to web server - will create new dist directory in application root directory</p>

  <div class="display-3 mt-2 stitle p-2">Web Hosting Note - AWS S3 website hosting</div>
  <hr>	
  <p>
      Quick note regarding AWS S3 website hosting an Angular application.  As mentioned earlier, AWS S3 website will not have root ("/") as default context path.
      By default, a new Angular application generated from ng-new will use a root context "/" path, which will not work with a simple AWS S3 website.  To fix this
      situation, after creating a new Angular application, update the default index.html with your AWS S3 bucket name.  Specifically, change:
  </p>
  <p class="pl-5">
      <strong>base href="/"</strong>  tag to <strong>base href="/%%YOUR_AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME%%/"</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
      This change will tell Angular application to add AWS S3 bucket name to the URL path that is appended on <strong>http://s3.amazonaws.com/</strong> site.
  </p>
